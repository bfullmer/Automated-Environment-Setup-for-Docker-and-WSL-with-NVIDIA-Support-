```

3. **Update Main Script**:
   In `src/main.py`, import and use the custom tools:

```python
import os
from crewai import Crew, Process, Task
from configparser import ConfigParser
from tools.github_tools import GitHubTool

# Load API keys from environment or config file
config = ConfigParser()
config.read('config.ini')

GITHUB_TOKEN = config.get('github', 'token')
github_tool = GitHubTool(token=GITHUB_TOKEN)

# Define agents, tasks, and tools here...

project_manager_task = Task(
    description='Track project milestones, assign issues to sprints, and update project board.',
    expected_output='Updated project board with assigned issues and milestones.',
    tools=[github_tool],
    agent=project_manager,
)

developer_task = Task(
    description='Review and merge pull requests, ensure code quality, and resolve merge conflicts.',
    expected_output='Merged pull requests with resolved conflicts.',
    tools=[github_tool],
    agent=developer,
)

devops_task = Task(
    description='Set up and maintain CI/CD pipelines, ensure automated testing and deployment.',
    expected_output='Functional CI/CD pipeline and successful deployment logs.',
    tools=[github_tool],
    agent=devops,
)

security_task = Task(
    description='Monitor repository for security vulnerabilities, manage security issues.',
    expected_output='Resolved security issues and updated dependency versions.',
    tools=[github_tool],
    agent=security,
)

documentation_task = Task(
    description='Update README, create and maintain project documentation, manage wiki.',
    expected_output='Updated README and comprehensive project documentation.',
    tools=[github_tool],
    agent=documentation,
)

community_task = Task(
    description='Manage issues, discussions, and contributor interactions, ensure adherence to community guidelines.',
    expected_output='Engaged community with managed issues and discussions.',
    tools=[github_tool],
    agent=community,
)

crew = Crew(
    agents=[project_manager, developer, devops, security, documentation, community],
    tasks=[project_manager_task, developer_task, devops_task, security_task, documentation_task, community_task],
    process=Process.sequential
)

result = crew.kickoff(inputs={})
print(result)
```

### Running the Project

To run the project, execute the main script:

```sh
python src/main.py
```

### Configuration

Ensure you have a `config.ini` file with your GitHub token:

```ini
[github]
token = your_github_token_here
```

This setup provides a comprehensive crew for managing a GitHub project and repository, covering project management, development, DevOps, security, documentation, and community engagement.
