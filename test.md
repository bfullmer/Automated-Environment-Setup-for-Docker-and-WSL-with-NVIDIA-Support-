### Steps to Update:
1. **Banner URL**: Replace `https://example.com/banner.jpg` with the actual URL of your banner image.
2. **YouTube Channel ID**: Replace `YOUR_CHANNEL_ID` with your actual YouTube channel ID.
3. **Icon URL**: If you want to host the icon on GitHub, upload it to your repository and use the correct path.

### Example Banner and Icon Hosting:
If you don't have URLs for the banner and icon, you can host them in your GitHub repository and link them accordingly. For example:

1. Upload `banner.jpg` and `icon.jpeg` to your repository.
2. Use the raw GitHub URL to reference these images in your README:

```markdown
[![Coach's YouTube Channel Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY/main/banner.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/YOUR_CHANNEL_ID)

![Coach's Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY/main/icon.jpeg)
```

Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPOSITORY` with your actual GitHub username and repository name. This way, the images will be properly displayed in your README.
